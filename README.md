# Messenger: a game about evolution and survival

This is the game in which the player would lead its follower and compete with other groups. The last surviving group would win the game. 

![demo](https://github.com/grassking100/messenger/blob/master/pic.jpg?raw=true)

## Features:
1. Every creature has its own genes, which would affect its behavior and property. The genes would pass down to its offspring by some mutation. Natural selection and player selection would direct its path of evolution.
2. The creature could decide to contribute energy points and build a temple that would have some magical effect on the local region.
3. Player could affect terrain, weather, and sea level to lead to victory or mass extinction.
